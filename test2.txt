commands

These are only some very basic facts about emacs. To learn more, the on-line tutorial within emacs itself is very good. To get to it type (within emacs):
CTRL-h t
To execute Control commands, written as CTRL-letter, hold down the Control key while typing the letter indicated.
To execute Escape commands, written as ESC letter, press the Escape key (once) and then type the letter indicated.

To start emacs, type

emacs filename
and hit the Return key.
To exit emacs, type

CTRL-x CTRL-c
You will be asked whether you want to save the file.
You can also save your work without exiting, by typing

CTRL-x CTRL-s
It is a good idea to do this regularly while editing your files, although emacs is pretty good at making backup copies (the names of those files end in ~) and saving your files if the system crashes (the names of those files begin with #).
